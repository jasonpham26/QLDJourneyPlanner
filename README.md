# QLD Journey Planner

QLD Journey Planner has been developed as a traffic and journey information service, and discovery-based platform. It provides state-wide information on road conditions, including incidents and hazards, closures and restrictions, roadworks and special events, and more in real-time. The service also allows access to web cameras that relay near real-time traffic imagery. In addition, users can enter a start and end location on a map, and for it to return directions between those two points, with all places along the routes, which matches a search term and then find out more details of places if they wish.
